        Hi, I am Ivo Léon, BSc Industrial Design graduate and current MSc ID
        student at Eindhoven University of Technology. Furthermore, I am a
        designer specializing user research & evaluation, as well as designing
        and prototyping both physical and digital products.
      </div>
      <div class="textblock introtext">
        As a designer I aim to create impactful products and services that match
        innovation to user needs and requirements. I find it important to design
        with vision and create products that provide value to the end user. I do
        this through three important principles: Empathy, Curiosity and
        Flexibility. Empathy helps to understand the user and create meaningful
        products. Curiosity helps to take a deep dive into the design and
        context, to find out what is truly important when designing a product or
        system. Flexibility helps to adapt to the often changing landscape of
        design and utilize design processes that fit the specific project. These
        principles, among many other smaller ones, guide my design activities.
      </div>
      <div class="textblock introtext">
        During the past 4+ years of my study I have completed a wide range of
        design projects, of which a selection is presented below. Please take a
        look and feel free to contact me in case of questions or interest.

        <div class="textsection">
          <div class="textblock">
            The Artificial Womb is a life support system for extreme premature
            babies. When babies are born 22 to 24 weeks into the pregnancy their
            chance of survival is very low. Therefore the artificial womb aims
            to replace neonatal incubators and mimic the conditions in the
            uterus, to provide the highest survival rate and minimize negative
            side effects of premature birth.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            The starting point for this project was a range of research papers
            proving that the artificial womb was possible, which detailed the
            requirements. This information, together with expert interviews and
            user research was translated to the first real design of the
            artificial womb, which was in turn improved over multiple
            iterations.

            The goal of this project was not to design a product that is
            market-ready, due to the sheer complexity of the subject. However,
            it embodies the current knowledge and provides a concept-design that
            functions as a stepping stone for further development and research.

          <div class="textblock">
            Emergency rooms in hospitals are often busy & chaotic places. Most
            people are in pain or discomfort and want to be helped as quickly as
            possible. However, even though some conditions are very unpleasant,
            not all require immediate attention. Combined with limited staff and
            capacity, patients are often waiting for extended times, which is
            often very stressful. This is why we have created the Calmscape.

            The Calmscape is a physical artwork that is to be placed in waiting
            rooms of hospitals. Scenes of natures are shown to help calm people
            and actuators within the design allow the canvas to move subtly.
            These small movements help to draw attention to the artwork and
            maintain it, distracting the patients from their discomfort and
            other patients waiting in the emergency room. Testing with the
            Calmscape has shown that it both has a relaxing and distracting
            effect on users.

        <h3>Stress Management Research</h3>
        <div class="textsection">
          <div class="textblock">
            This research project looked at stress management practices. Stress
            can have large effect on both mental and physical health. Extensive
            research has shown that a wide range of health conditions can arise
            from stress, specifically chronic stress. One possible complication
            is Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD). CVD patients are especially
            vulnerable to reoccurring complications and therefore effective
            stress management is vitally important. Based on this a large scale
            research project at the TU/e is being conducted, focusing on
            monitoring different lifestyle factors of CVD patients, including
            stress levels.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            From this my own research project has stemmed. The platform itself
            only provides insight into the stress levels of patients and does
            not provide any guidance. At the same time a large amount of stress
            management techniques exist. This prompted me to compare stress
            awareness and stress management technique usage between 2 groups:
            one group that only measured their stress levels and received this
            as feedback and the second group was stimulated to engage in stress
            management based on behavior change models.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            To conduct this research I have created a digital prototype in the
            form a website, which was both able to provide the participants with
            the measurements and persuasive messages as well allow them to
            record the data that I needed to analyze the results. The results
            show to that intervention usage did not significantly increase for
            both groups. However, the stress awareness did significantly
            increase for the measurement group.

            During one of my project courses we have designed a new way to
            display notifications, with the aim to make digital connectivity
            less intrusive. The design process was mainly focused on using
            crowdsourcing platforms, online communities and online workers to
            aid in the creation of the design, as these can be very powerful
            tools.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            The project started with a need-finding phase, where online workers
            (through Prolific & M-Turk) were asked to complete a survey to study
            the problems and opportunities related to the subject of
            notifications and digital connectivity. Based on the results a new
            group of workers was asked to come up with concepts. These concepts
            were then filtered by us, and presented for online evaluation. The
            best received concept was then further iterated upon by us, to
            finally be sent to a digital artist to visualize the concept. The
            final concept took the form of a painting/artwork, which would
            change scene when the user would receive a notification. Albeit it
            being a luxury item, it provides a subtle way to display
            notifications, without interrupting the user and maintaining privacy
            of the content of the notifications.

        <h3>Increasing Fitness Guidance</h3>
        <div class="textsection">
          <div class="textblock">
            The last project that I have completed targets people that practice
            fitness within a gym. Fitness has a range of both physical and
            mental benefits and is very widely practiced with the industry
            growing larger every day. With the low entry barrier, due to low
            costs and abundant gyms available it is practiced by many.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            However, there are also problems that arise within this context.
            Based on explorative interviews several themes arose, including
            problems with intimidation, occupation of equipment, form, beginner
            guidance and motivation. Further analysis through user journey
            mapping and a Co-Design session has steered the project towards a
            focus on guiding people that just start out with fitness. It was
            shown that a barrier is often experienced when asking for help,
            especially with beginners. Therefore a technical prototype was
            developed, designed specifically for easy integration in the gym
            with the aim of evaluation. The system consists of a small box with
            a button, which can be used to ask for assistance. It is linked via
            Wifi to a website that notifies the trainers. The system is focused
            on a simplistic external design, in order to make it easy to use and
            decrease the barrier for asking trainers for help as much as
            possible.
