                  <strong><em></em></strong>Technology is continuously advancing
                  and innovating. This is generally a good thing as the average
                  quality of life has drastically through this. As technological
                  advancement is neutral of itself, I believe that
                  <strong>guiding innovation</strong> is a major role of current
                  and future designers. <strong>Generating a positive</strong>,
                  preferably big, <strong>impact</strong> on society is
                  therefore one of my main ambitions. To be able to guide the
                  technological development the designer needs<strong>
                    in-depth knowledge of their chosen field of
                    technology</strong
                  >.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="development-paragraph text-size-regular text-color-grey"
                >
                  Even though innovation is often not as black and white as
                  having a positive or negative effect, I believe that designers
                  can increase the generated value and minimize negative
                  effects, through a user-centered design process and a
                  <strong>dedication to quality</strong>. To generate value, you
                  need to know who you innovate for and what their needs are,
                  and thus users should constantly be taken into account.
                  Furthermore, they should be included in the processes early
                  and often, to verify inevitable assumptions. This is why the
                  designer should have
                  <strong>firm grasp on user involvement</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="development-paragraph text-size-regular">
                  A key enabling factor for impactful design is a
                  <strong>critical mindset and holistic view</strong>. This
                  allows the designer to take a broader perspective and
                  critically reflect on the design, while weighing the options.
                  However, in order to be able to provide a holistic and
                  critical view, the designer needs to be
                  <strong>knowledgeable about the variety of subjects</strong>.
                  Therefore, it is important that designers have an
                  understanding of multiple disciplines, like engineering,
                  business and user research. This is will also allow the
                  designer to apply their knowledge and collaborate within a
                  multidisciplinary team.

                  Because of these skills I prefer to focus on the
                  <strong>concept development and evaluation stage</strong> of
                  the design process. This is also where my strengths shine;
                  through user evaluation with high-fidelity prototypes and can
                  provide valuable insights to steer the future direction of
                  projects. This is also why I see myself as the
                  <strong>realizer</strong> within a team, transforming potent
                  ideas into actionable concepts.

                  I furthermore see myself as a <strong>team-player</strong>, as
                  I prefer to work within multidisciplinary teams. This allows
                  me to use the knowledge of experts in different areas and
                  through a <strong>critical and holistic view</strong> make
                  substantiated decisions within the design process. This is
                  also why I see myself as an <strong>analyst</strong>, being
                  able to see the bigger picture and extract the high-level
                  insights, through critical reflection. This allows me to
                  uphold a <strong>dedication to quality</strong>.

                  Just as knowledge about technology is needed to collaborate
                  with technology experts, multidisciplinary knowledge is needed
                  for effectively working within multidisciplinary teams. This
                  is why I developed myself broadly. I see myself as a
                  <strong>T-shaped designer</strong>, having broad knowledge of
                  a variety of subjects, while having deep knowledge regarding
                  users and technology. This is further supported by my
                  <strong>flexible and curious </strong>attitude.

                  Lastly, time and resources are always limited. To ensure that
                  these are used to the fullest potential I try to work
                  <strong>efficiently and effectively</strong>. This is done
                  through choosing the right approach fitting for the goal of
                  the activity, such as a quick exploration versus an in-depth
                  study. Furthermore, through an interest in project management
                  and the use of various methods, methodologies and tools, this
                  goal is aided.

                  I have chosen my courses to be in line with my specialization
                  areas of Technology &amp; Realization and User &amp; Society.
                  They aided my development as a designer through improving
                  <strong>experience, knowledge and mindset</strong>.

                  First of all, the courses gave me
                  <strong>experience</strong> working in my areas of expertise.
                  During
                  <strong

                  (DUIET) and

                  >
                  (EIBSC), I developed my realization skills through the design
                  of a variety of prototypes, both with lo-fi electronics as
                  with digital, further develop my data and computing skills.
                  Furthermore,
                  <strong>Community experience design</strong> (CXD), and
                  <strong>Constructive design research</strong> (CDR) had me
                  conducting thorough user research, such as thematic analysis,
                  and using a range user experience design tools. These tools
                  aid in maximizing generated value by playing to your strengths
                  and using all resources that are available.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="development-paragraph text-size-regular text-color-black"
                >
                  The courses also allowed me to gather a lot of
                  <strong>knowledge</strong> about the subject itself as well as
                  about different tools, theories and approaches.
                  <strong>User experience theory and practice</strong> (UXTP),
                  and <strong>Design for behavioral change</strong> (DBC), made
                  me aware of the different approaches for design user
                  experience, as well as introducing a range of theories and
                  design tools. Examples are COM-B analysis for behavior design
                  and designing from different person perspectives. UXTP did not
                  only focus on designing user experience, but also on defining
                  user experience, which aided in gaining a
                  <strong>deeper understanding of the subject</strong>. DBC was
                  also strongly linked to
                  <strong>vision on value generation</strong> for users through
                  improving their behavior and highlighted a more societal focus
                  through the ethical side of designing for behavioral change.

                  Lastly the courses aided in developing my designer
                  <strong>mindset</strong>. Taking different perspectives on
                  design, such as different levels of abstracting, during
                  <strong>Matters of transformation</strong> (MT) and UXTP,
                  sharpened my view on design. It furthermore challenged me to
                  critically look at design and the underlying goals and
                  principles. This role of a critical analyst was also taken in
                  my CDR team, further cementing it as a part of my
                  <a href="#Professional-Identity">Professional Identity</a>.
                  DUIET did not only focus on working with technology, but also
                  learning to envision possible uses for new technologies,
                  focusing more on the <strong>way of thinking</strong>.

                  My main strength within this area is in a more defined
                  context, where I can explore different directions. This is for
                  example used during the design of ATOM in the exploration of
                  casing shapes, where I made extensive use of 3D printing to
                  explore options.

                  One of my main ways of utilizing this area of expertise is for
                  supporting communication. With my skills in creating renders
                  and visuals I am able to visually communicate important
                  information. Examples are the manual created for ATOM, as well
                  as renders for communication to a range parties. I focus on a
                  clean aesthetic style for clear communication, playing to my
                  strengths this way.

                  Even though I wouldn’t consider myself an extreme creative, I
                  think that one of my strengths is brainstorm creative
                  solutions to complex problems. An example is the design of the
                  casing, where it needed to have an exposed PCB, needed to be
                  waterproof to protect the other electronics, but where the PCB
                  is still removable.

                  My specialization in this area resulted in insight and
                  theoretical knowledge, as well as practical knowledge and
                  skills. The insight and knowledge aid me in communicating and
                  working with experts on technology. For example, during the
                  design of ATOM I was able to create the schematic for the core
                  processor and efficiently work with the layouter, which
                  resulted in a functional PCB.

                  Furthermore, my practical skills in this area allow me to
                  design my own prototypes. I have experience with creating both
                  lo-fi and high-fi prototypes. For example, when designing a
                  small modular sensing devices as a proof of concept for ATOM,

                  My experience with realizing products has also left me a range
                  of tools at me disposal, such as digital design tools, rapid
                  prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and laser cutting
                  as well as working with a range of materials. For example, a
                  demonstrator casing for ATOM was created using 3D printing and
                  laser cutting.

                  For me this area of expertise is one of the core aspects of
                  design and creating value. It allows you to conduct various
                  types of user research, such as exploration, evaluation and
                  validation, in order to support your design. Furthermore, it
                  focuses on integrating a range of different stakeholders into
                  the design process. It also helps to build a critical mindset
                  with a user-centered focus.

                  Through <a href="#Past">UXTP, CXD and MT</a> I have further
                  developed this area, building a critical, holistic view as
                  well as gaining experience with a variety of tools. For
                  example, my FMP had a clear starting point, designing a
                  modular electronics system. However, through a lot of scoping
                  with different stakeholders, it was also defined who the
                  product would be for, why they would use it and what value it
                  adds.

                  I have experience with both explorative research, which was
                  done a lot during the design of ATOM, as well as evaluation
                  through qualitative research <a href="#Past">(CDR)</a> and
                  quantitative research
                  <a href="stress-management-research.html">(M1.2)</a>. It
                  furthermore helps to work with different stakeholders, such as
                  freelancers, team members and experts, analyze their roles and
                  build strong value propositions. I think one of the important
                  parts of specialization in this area is the internalization of
                  user integration and constant reflection on the value
                  generation.

                  I find that this area is very important when generating value
                  with your design. Both a user and a business perspective help
                  to build a strong value proposition, linking the two areas
                  together in the way I use them. It furthermore helps to place
                  the design in a realistic context, aiding in creating impact.
                  Especially in corporate settings knowledge is needed to make a
                  trade-off between profit and impact.

                  For example, during the design of ATOM consumers were one of
                  envisioned target segments, however through a competitor
                  analysis profit margins proved to be minimal. Thus,
                  successfully targeting consumers means simplifying the design
                  and moving away from the core values. However, shifting focus
                  to business and organizations gives the room to further focus
                  on the core values, increasing the impact. This focus on
                  specific segments also aids in further shaping the design to
                  their needs and wishes.

                  Knowledge in this area also helps to frame your design in a
                  business context and go beyond just the design itself. This
                  knowledge further developed by working within a start-up,
                  where it always plays a role, and implementation in the
                  project. For example, through the creation of a business model
                  for ATOM and evaluation during business events such as MEDICA,
                  you are able to define you market strategy. Furthermore, it
                  allows you to place new designs in or outside of (current)
                  product portfolios. All these things again have an effect on
                  the design, showing the constant interplay between User &amp;
                  Society and Business &amp; Entrepreneurship.

                  For me the main application of this area is through
                  programming prototypes, working with software and analyzing
                  complex data from user research. My focus on designing
                  physical technological products requires a strong grasp on
                  math, data and computing to support the design process. This
                  becomes evident during the design of electronics for example,
                  especially when working at a higher fidelity. During the
                  design of the ATOM core processor PCB, a trial-and-error
                  approach was not suited due to production times, so exact
                  approach was required.

                  Furthermore, working with powerful 3D software such as
                  SolidWorks allows me to design products and evaluate ideas
                  before the concepts are realized. Coding is another important
                  part of this area, as it is used for both digital prototypes
                  and programming electronics. These skills were largely
                  developed when adding wireless communication to
                  <a href="ludis.html">Ludis</a> and for example when analyzing
                  the input data from the multi-touch kit (a 2d touchpad)
                  designed for <a href="#Past">DUIET</a>. This knowledge was
                  applied during the programming of the core processor and
                  module to create an interactive LED demonstrator.

                  Lastly the area aids in analyzing data gathered from user
                  research. Organizing, structuring and analyzing data is an
                  essential part of conducting user research to be able to draw
                  supported conclusions. This can be regarding either
                  qualitative or quantitative data, where an example of the
                  latter can be seen in the statistical analysis of the results
                  during my M1.2 project. It can also automate data analysis

                  This project has been a good test and development opportunity

                  Extensive communication was required to work together with
                  team members, but also to outside parties like freelancers,
                  manufacturers, other companies and users. This was tested in
                  situations like communicating about the design with layouter
                  and during presentations like the MEDICA Trade Fair.
                  Communication and cooperation are supported by the use of a

                  Organizing and planning was important during this project due
                  to the breadth of the scope at the start of the project. For
                  organization a range of tools was used such as KANBAN. A
                  preliminary planning was drafted based on milestones &amp;
                  deadlines and important phases of the project based on company
                  goals and my development goals. Continuous reflection in
                  action was used to evaluate the state of the project and
                  planning and adjust it where needed. For example, four
                  iterations of prototyping and testing were planned. However,
                  this proved to be unrealistic and instead a large number of
                  small iterations were done on the design, as well as a
                  high-fidelity prototype iteration and conceptual iteration.

                  and develop new technologies. It also means that I was able to
                  further develop this aspects of my vision and the
                  complementary skillset. Another important part of the project
                  was looking into who would use the device and why. This meant
                  that integrating a user-centered approach to guide the
                  development.

                  I also worked together with a company on a product that is
                  planned to be put on the market. This ‘real’ project helps to
                  generate impact, especially compared isolated student projects
                  that I have done in the past.

                  The project also helped to further develop my vision and
                  identity. I deem working within a multidisciplinary team an
                  important strength of me as a designer and to support and
                  develop this I did my graduation project as an internship. The
                  project further helped to abstract and clarify my vision,
                  moving away from healthcare and vitality, while still
                  incorporating the values I hold high. Working within the team
                  also allowed me to further discover my strengths as a
                  designer, finding where I can add value within the team.

                  In my experience this project has presented a big step in my
                  development. The project was in line with my vision and
                  identity and allowed me to both follow my passion, as well as
                  further develop myself. This was aided by the professional and
                  realistic context where I completed my FMP, through working on
                  a product that will actually be brought to market. Designing
                  ATOM has furthermore given me a lot of time to further
                  specialize in designing technology for users and developing
                  the relevant skillsets. Working within a small
                  multidisciplinary team further developed my broad knowledge
                  and holistic view. Lastly it was another opportunity to learn
                  and apply different methodologies and tools for an effective
                  design process, while providing a first step into project
                  management as well.

                  For the future I have three major goals. First of all I would
                  like to work together with other designers again and be able
                  to learn from them. I feel I have developed a strong designer
                  mindset and an extensive skillset for designing. However, I
                  also feel there is a lot more to learn in regards to practical
                  skills and tools. Furthermore, I have developed my skills in
                  project management mainly on a personal level. But I am also
                  interested in learning this on a team level, to see how this
                  aids in being efficient and effective as a team. Lastly my
                  vision has developed over my education career, shifting from a
                  focus on healthcare to a more abstract vision on design, with
                  a preference for physical product design. I am interested in
                  discovering how my vision and interest further develop over
                  the course of my career.
